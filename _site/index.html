      <h2> Our Story - the fairytale edition </h2>
      <div class="story">
      <p class="padded-2"> Once upon a time there was an independent and motivated princess. She appeared to have it all, yet something was missing. With all her hard work and trappings of success, she had created a wonderful life albeit no one, other than her excitable fur child Molly, to share it with. While Molly was wonderful company and they enjoyed many long walks along the beach together the princess grew tired of SCADA duties, and the beautiful provincial life on Morningtons Peninsula. One day she left in search of adventure and companionship. Under the guise of expanding her realestate empire, she traveled north to a domain known as the Central Coast. Upon her arrival, she became enamoured with a beautiful young man. In the past, they had met briefly at a ball or two but unfortunately had been otherwise occupied. The young man was not the stiff and preened royalty she was accustomed to in the capital, but he was not without his own savage charm.</p>
      <p class="padded-2"> He loved her self-reliance and ambition. She fell for his dedication, wild spirit and humour. It wasn’t long before love blossomed and they decided to start life together. Shortly after combining their meager assets under one roof, the princess was summoned to perform SCADA duties for the great Transgrid regime. Although they had a wonderful life on the Central Coast, filled with allies and surrounded by natural beauty, the prince decided to give that up in order to follow his princess. She would need his protection if they were to reside in the wild west region of the Sydney Kingdom.</p>
      <p class="padded-2">Together the couple fought wicked vendors, pushy realestate agents and an incompetant solicitor in the battle to claim a place to live. In the eleventh hour, when all looked lost, they finally recieved the keys to their very own castle in the town where the ropes cross. To celebrate this victory and the second anniverary of their first date, the young couple decided to expand their family by adopting another fur child. Diesel, a rough and tumble boy from staffordshire joined them and the family was complete.  </p>
      <p class="padded-2"> One day, on a day that was just like any other the princess returned home from a day of corperate battles to find the young man was down on bended knee. Her initial alarm turned to joyous tears as he proposed that this life they had created was quite nice, and he would like to continue on enjoying it with her by his side for as long as life would allow them, should she wish. The young princess agreed that she too would like to continue facing the world by his side, so accepted the offer of his hand.</p>
      <p class="padded-2"> You have reached the end of this tale but not the entire story, additional adventures of the prince and princess Claassens are being had even as we speak, theirs is a story that shall be continued...

Hotel Budir, where the chapel is located, is on the west coast of Iceland. The area looks out to the ocean with a backdrop of beautiful green mountains and lush grass land. We chose this area for its uniqueness and in the hope of catching the northern lights for a truely magical day. We have planned a morning ceremony that will be followed by a day of picnics and exploring the beutiful surrounding area.  </p>

        <p> The story of how this website came to be. Why spend hundreds of dollars having someone else create a wedding website for you when you could learn to do it yourself? This is the question I asked myself about 6 months ago. While some might call me obsessive, I like to think my want to personalise and create things exactly as I imagine them comes from... </p>
